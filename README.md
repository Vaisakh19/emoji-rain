# Emoji-Rain
A fun, browser-based game where you control a basket to catch falling emojis! Catch only the **target emoji** shown on the screen — miss it or catch the wrong one, and the game ends.

## Demo

👉 [Play the Game on Vercel](https://emojirain.vercel.app)  


##  How to Play

1. When the game starts, a random **target emoji** is displayed.
2. All kinds of emojis fall from the top.
3. Use your **left (`←`)** and **right (`→`)** arrow keys (or **A/D** keys) to move the basket.
4. **Catch only the target emoji**.
5. If you:
   - Catch the **wrong emoji** → **Game Over**
   - **Miss** the target emoji (let it fall) → **Game Over**
6. If you **catch the correct emoji**, your score increases by 1 and a new target emoji is selected for the next round.
7. The game continues until a mistake is made.
